# Pre-installed VM

Download and install VirtualBox for your OS: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Restart your computer.

Download the VM:
- Arm (Apple Silicon): [https://cloud.ilabt.imec.be/index.php/s/er4atfBsJwDTn3E](https://cloud.ilabt.imec.be/index.php/s/eCAYwwaxGTXbfSf)
- x86: https://cloud.ilabt.imec.be/index.php/s/5DH2d5dtEFgjsrb

> These VMs have user `sbom` with password `sbom`. 

>Note: The VM sometimes resets to QWERTY, keep this in mind when typing in the password. If you need to change the keyboard layout to match your system, [this guide](https://itsfoss.com/ubuntu-change-keyboard/) will help you. Hint: MacOS AZERTY is `French Macintosh` on Ubuntu.

Open VirtualBox and click import, select the .ova file you downloaded.

Your VM should now start. All tools are available from the command line.
