# Understanding the SBoM

This document outlines the SBoM generated from the Jave project in this workshop. You can follow along with your SBoM, details such as hashes or timestamps will likely be different.

## 1. File Format and Overall Structure  
The document follows the [SPDX 2.3](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/) format, a standard for Software Bill of Materials (SBoM) data. It starts with metadata describing:  
- **Who created the SBoM**: `Anchore, Inc`, using `syft-1.20.0`  
- **When it was created**: `2025-03-20T15:10:57Z` (yours will be different)
- **License terms for the SBoM itself**: `CC0-1.0` (public domain)  

## 2. Top-Level Document  
- The SBoM is named **`myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`**.  
- `documentNamespace` provides a unique identifier to prevent collisions with other SPDX documents.  
- The **SPDXID `SPDXRef-DOCUMENT`** represents the document itself.  

## 3. Packages  
The JSON lists three software packages:

### **Gson**

The dependency for processing JSON in the code. 

- **Name**: `gson`
- **Version**: `2.10.1`
- **Declared License**: `Apache-2.0`
- **This is a dependency used in the application.**

### **Myapp**

This is the app we just built, note that it does not define any license information as we did not specify any.

- **Name**: `myapp`
- **Version**: `1.0-SNAPSHOT`
- **Declared License**: `NOASSERTION`

### **JAR File (`myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`)**

The JAR containing

- **Checksum (SHA256)**: f7b...6c82 
- **Marked as a primary file in SPDX terms.** Indicates that this is the main artefact.

## 4. Files  
The `files` array describes the JAR itself:  
- It includes **SHA1** and **SHA256 checksums** to uniquely identify it.  
- Classified as an `APPLICATION` file.  
- **License**: `"NOASSERTION"` (this again makes sense as we did not define one).  

## 5. Relationships  
The SBoM defines several SPDX relationships which define how software components interact, such as dependencies, file inclusions, and document associations. They indicate whether a package depends on another, whether a file contains a specific component, or whether an SBoM describes a particular artifact. This structure helps with dependency tracking, security analysis, and license compliance, ensuring that tools and auditors can understand how different elements relate within a software system.

- **`DEPENDENCY_OF`**  
 `gson` â†’ `myapp` (indicates `gson` is a direct dependency).  

- **`CONTAINS`**  
 The JAR file **contains** both `myapp` and `gson`.  

- **`OTHER / evident-by`**  
 The existence of `gson` and `myapp` is **evident-by** the JAR file. Note that this is a Syft specific thing, not part of the SPDX standard. 

- **`DESCRIBES`**  
 The top-level document (`SPDXRef-DOCUMENT`) **describes** the JAR file.  

## 6. Licenses  
- The `gson` library is explicitly under **Apache-2.0**.  
- The license for `myapp` and the JAR is `"NOASSERTION"` (once more, makes sense as we didn't define one).  

## 7. External References  
- **CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)** references for security tools.  
- **purl (Package URL)** references for package managers.  
- These help with **vulnerability scanning** and **software identification**.  


## Conclusion:

The SBoM **describes** `myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`, which contains:  
- The `myapp` application  
- The `gson` library (`2.10.1`)  
- The **license for `myapp` is undefined**, but `gson` is Apache-2.0.  

You can now return to the main [README](README.md)!
