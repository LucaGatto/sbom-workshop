# How to install the required tools

If you do not have Ubuntu yet (VM, WSL, regular installation) the easiest way to get all the required tools is to run our pre-installed VM. You can find the instructions [here](VM.md).

If you already have Ubuntu and want the just install the tools, we provide an [`install.sh`](install.sh) script or you can follow the instructions [here](Ubuntu.md).

The tools can also be installed natively on most Linux distros and MacOS but use this at your own risk. The links to the developers' installation guides are [here](other.md).
